# JS Basics Labs

🚧 **Work in Progress**

A growing collection of beginner JavaScript projects built gradually to strengthen core fundamentals through hands-on practice.

Each lab focuses on a specific concept such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic state management.

## Current Labs

### Counter Application
An interactive counter with advanced features for practicing DOM manipulation, state management, and event handling.

**Features:**
- ✅ Increment/Decrement with customizable step size
- ✅ Min/Max limit enforcement with visual warnings
- ✅ Color-coded display (blue for positive, red for negative, white for zero)
- ✅ Button state management (auto-disable at limits)
- ✅ Counter history tracking (last 10 values)
- ✅ Input validation (prevents invalid step/limit values)
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation:
  - **↑** Arrow Up: Increase counter
  - **↓** Arrow Down: Decrease counter
  - **R**: Reset counter to 0
  - **C**: Clear history while keeping current value

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and animations (pulse effect on limit warnings)
- Vanilla JavaScript for logic and interactivity
